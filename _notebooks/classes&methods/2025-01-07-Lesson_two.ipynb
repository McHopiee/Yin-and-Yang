    "\n",
    "Afterwards, there is a list of each object. The `this` in items like `this.food` and `this.drink` works similar to a placeholder. Later, this placeholder will be replaced by things like `jacksfridge` and `nicosfridge`. The body of the class, which contains the class members ( *constructor* ) and the object you're making a class of, is all going to be held inside curly brackets `{}`."
